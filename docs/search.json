While companies often assume that high-performing employees are also highly engaged, putting this assumption to the statistical test can provide surprising insights and act as an early warning sign of misalignment between performance management and employee experience."

All data was generated in R.\nThe database sample file includes the following columns:\n\nPerformanceRatings: manager ratings of each employee, for a performance review cycle, scale 1-5, where 5 means a higher performance level;\nEngagement: overall employee engagement, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\nRewards: driver of engagement measuring employee satisfaction with compensation & rewards, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\nAccomplishment: driver of engagement measuring employee sense of accomplishment in daily work, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\nManagerRelations: driver of engagement measuring employee satisfaction with managerial support they receive, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\nGoals: driver of engagement measuring employee clarity of their work goals, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\nPeerSupport: driver of engagement measuring employee satisfaction with peer support they receive from the team, average of multiple questions, NPS scale 0-10;\n\nFor testing the relationship between engagement and performance I conduct a series of one-way ANOVA tests, analyzing if a more positive employee sentiment (overall Engagement and other drivers of engagement) is reported among the top performing employees."

Although I truly enjoyed teaching and deep-diving into interesting research topics, I eventually decided that academia was not the right fit for me. People analytics felt like a natural career transition, as it allows me to continue analyzing survey responses, performing statistical analyses, working with qualitative data, and writing concise, actionable reports.\nAs many other people data analysts, I work at the intersection of data analytics, data science, data governance, and decision-making.\nI’m originally from Romania but I currently live in Madrid, with my loving partner, Ada, and our cat, Vlahuta.

    "text": "Conclusion & Recommendations\n\nConclusion\nThe results provide evidence of a performance culture in which higher performance is associated with higher engagement and a stronger sense of accomplishment.\nHowever, the findings also point to potential imbalances. While top performers are rewarded more, medium performers (representing 52% of the workforce) do not appear to be clearly differentiated from low performers in terms of rewards. In addition, lower-performing employees report more positive manager relations, which may indicate that managerial attention is disproportionately focused on performance remediation rather than sustained engagement across all performance levels.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nSustain engagement and accomplishment among top performers: The strong association between performance, engagement, and accomplishment suggests that existing practices supporting autonomy, mastery, and meaningful work should be maintained and reinforced for high performers.\nRe-examine reward differentiation for medium performers: The lack of meaningful reward differences between low and medium performers may weaken motivation in the middle of the performance distribution. Introducing clearer performance-linked recognition for medium performers could help prevent disengagement and performance stagnation.\nBalance managerial attention across performance groups: While supporting low performers is important, the stronger manager relations reported by low performers suggest a potential over-correction. Managers should be encouraged to invest equally in coaching and development conversations with medium and high performers to sustain long-term engagement.\nUse engagement metrics as an early warning indicator: Given the modest but consistent link between engagement and performance, monitoring engagement trends by performance group can help identify emerging misalignments between performance management practices and employee experience before they affect outcomes."

People analytics challenges these assumptions and shows how data-driven people decisions can be beneficial for both the organisations and the employees.\nIf you are new to the field, it is worth mentioning that there are a lot of useful People Analytics & HR resources out there. See for example the Academy to Innovate HR blog or the Data Driven HR Monthly newsletter, as well as some great books that showcase actual data projects in the field of people analytics:\nWhile designed as data analytics portfolio, through this website I hope to share a few practical examples of real HR business questions, contributing to the popularization of people analytics for better people decisions."
