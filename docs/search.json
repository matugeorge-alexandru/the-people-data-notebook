While companies often assume that high-performing employees are also highly engaged, putting this assumption to the statistical test can provide surprising insights and act as an early warning sign of misalignment between performance management and employee experience."

    "text": "Conclusion & Recommendations\n\nConclusion\nThe results provide evidence of a performance culture in which higher performance is associated with higher engagement and a stronger sense of accomplishment.\nHowever, the findings also point to potential imbalances. While top performers are rewarded more, medium performers (representing 52% of the workforce) do not appear to be clearly differentiated from low performers in terms of rewards. In addition, lower-performing employees report more positive manager relations, which may indicate that managerial attention is disproportionately focused on performance remediation rather than sustained engagement across all performance levels.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nSustain engagement and accomplishment among top performers: The strong association between performance, engagement, and accomplishment suggests that existing practices supporting autonomy, mastery, and meaningful work should be maintained and reinforced for high performers.\nRe-examine reward differentiation for medium performers: The lack of meaningful reward differences between low and medium performers may weaken motivation in the middle of the performance distribution. Introducing clearer performance-linked recognition for medium performers could help prevent disengagement and performance stagnation.\nBalance managerial attention across performance groups: While supporting low performers is important, the stronger manager relations reported by low performers suggest a potential over-correction. Managers should be encouraged to invest equally in coaching and development conversations with medium and high performers to sustain long-term engagement.\nUse engagement metrics as an early warning indicator: Given the modest but consistent link between engagement and performance, monitoring engagement trends by performance group can help identify emerging misalignments between performance management practices and employee experience before they affect outcomes."

People analytics challenges these assumptions and shows how data-driven people decisions can be beneficial for both the organisations and the employees.\nIf you are new to the field, it is worth mentioning that there are a lot of useful People Analytics & HR resources out there. See for example the Academy to Innovate HR blog or the Data Driven HR Monthly newsletter, as well as some great books that showcase actual data projects in the field of people analytics:\nWhile designed as data analytics portfolio, through this website I hope to share a few practical examples of real HR business questions, contributing to the popularization of people analytics for better people decisions."

Beyond adjusting salaries in response to inflation and competitive pressures on the labour market, these cycles provide an opportunity to address any legacy issues, such as internal inequities, or employees being positioned too low within their salary ranges.\nEqually important, the Compensation Review process is a key mechanism for reinforcing a performance culture within the organisation, by differentiating rewards based on employee performance. Therefore, throughout the comp review, one particularly relevant test for the entire process is to assess whether compensation outcomes vary systematically with performance levels.\nBusiness question: Do employees with higher performance ratings receive, on average, higher salary increases, equity awards, and total compensation growth compared to lower-performing peers?"

All data was generated in R.\nThe database sample file includes the following columns:\n\nPerformanceRatings: manager ratings of each employee, for a performance review cycle, scale 1-5, where 5 means a higher performance level;\nSalaryIncrease: percentage (%) increase of the annual salary for each employee (before vs. after comp review);\nEquityIncrease: percentage (%) increase of the equity or stocks awarded for each employee (before vs. after comp review);\nTotalCompIncrease: annualized percentage (%) increase of the total compensation (salary + equity) for each employee (before vs. after comp review). Note, the equity awarded has a 4 year vesting period, as per the industry standard practice, so in the calculation of the Annualized Total Comp(%) increase, the Equity Increase is divided by 4.\nCompaRatioBefore: employee’s compa-ratio prior to the compensation review cycle\nCompaRatioAfter: employee’s compa-ratio following the compensation review cycle, calculated based on the updated base salary after the applied salary increase.\nNote: The compa-ratio represents the relationship between an employee’s base salary and the midpoint of the corresponding salary range. A value of 1.00 indicates alignment with the market median for the role, while values below or above 1.00 indicate positioning below or above the range midpoint, respectively. Compa-ratio is based on base salary only and does not reflect equity or other non-cash compensation components.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nFor testing the relationship between performance and compensation review outcomes, I conduct a series of one-way ANOVA tests, analyzing if a higher percentage increase in salary, equity or total compensation is reported among the top performing employees.\nAt the same time, to evaluate how compensation decisions affect employees’ positioning within their salary ranges, I analyze changes in compa-ratio before and after the compensation review cycle. Specifically, I compute within-employee compa-ratio deltas and assess whether the average magnitude of these changes differs across performance groups, using one-way ANOVA on compa-ratio changes complemented by paired comparisons."

This decision is also supported by the overall performance distribution (Table 1), ensuring a big enough sample size in each group.\nHowever, in order to properly test that rewards are increasing with performance we might want to differentiate more clearly the reward distribution among top-performers (see the Analysis & Results section below) .\n\n\nCode\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Understand the performance distribution\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\ndf_comp |&gt;\n  count(PerformanceRatings) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Performance rating\", \"Count\", \"Percentage (%)\"),\n    digits = 1,\n    caption = \"Table 1: Distribution of performance ratings\")\n\n\n\nTable 1: Distribution of performance ratings\n\n\nPerformance rating\nCount\nPercentage (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n50\n5\n\n\n2\n130\n13\n\n\n3\n520\n52\n\n\n4\n180\n18\n\n\n5\n120\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nOne extra-step is to convert the grouping variable ‘Performance’ into a factor.

    "text": "Conclusion & Recommendations\n\nConclusion\nThe results provide strong evidence that the compensation review process broadly follows a pay-for-performance principle. Higher-performing employees receive larger salary increases, equity awards, and annualized total compensation growth, and also experience greater upward movement within the salary range, as reflected in compa-ratio changes. The analysis further shows that most low performers are excluded from compensation increases (with only a small number of exceptions).\nHowever, a deeper examination within the top performance tier reveals no statistically significant differences between performance ratings 4 and 5, suggesting that differentiation among top performers may be more limited than expected.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nReview reward differentiation within the top performance tier: The absence of meaningful differences between ratings 4 and 5 was identified through analysis rather than design assumptions. Organisations may wish to assess whether this level of differentiation aligns with their intended performance philosophy or whether additional mechanisms are needed to recognise exceptional performance.\nFormalise eligibility criteria for low performers: While the general exclusion of low performers from increases is consistent with performance-based rewards, the presence of exceptions highlights the need for clear and consistently applied eligibility guidelines.\nContinue complementing compensation increase metrics with compa-ratio analysis: Reviewing both annual increases and resulting salary positioning helps ensure that compensation decisions remain aligned with performance incentives while supporting sustainable, long-term pay structures"

For this reason, in order to better illustrate the relationship between the outcomes of the compensation review process and performance we will exclude the employees with 0% increases from all the ANVOA tests conducted below.\n\nSalary Increase (%) by Performance\nThe one-way ANOVA shows a statistically significant difference in average salary increases across performance groups (F(2, 800) = 791.6, p &lt; .001). Only a very small number of low performers received a non-zero increase, indicating that most performers were not eligible for salary adjustments, with only limited exceptions.\nFocusing on the two main eligible groups, high performers received significantly higher salary increases than medium performers, as confirmed by post-hoc Tukey tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSalary Increase (%) by Performance: R code for ANVOA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# 1) ANOVA: SalaryIncrease by Performance (exclude 0% salary increases)\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Exclude employees with 0% Salary increase\ndf_salary &lt;- df_comp |&gt;\n  filter(SalaryIncrease &gt; 0)\n\n#Simple function for ANOVA test\naov_salary &lt;- aov(SalaryIncrease ~ Performance, data = df_salary)\nsummary(aov_salary)\n\n             Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nPerformance   2 0.18025 0.09013   791.6 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   800 0.09109 0.00011                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n#Descriptive table for comparing the means between the groups\nsalary_means &lt;- df_salary |&gt;\n  group_by(Performance) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    N = n(),\n    MeanSalaryIncrease = mean(SalaryIncrease),\n    .groups = \"drop\")\n\nsalary_means\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  Performance           N MeanSalaryIncrease\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;int&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Low performers       13             0.0103\n2 Medium performers   494             0.0501\n3 High performers     296             0.0784\n\n#Post-hoc test\nTukeyHSD(aov_salary)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = SalaryIncrease ~ Performance, data = df_salary)\n\n$Performance\n                                        diff        lwr        upr p adj\nMedium performers-Low performers  0.03982794 0.03278806 0.04686781     0\nHigh performers-Low performers    0.06808082 0.06098083 0.07518081     0\nHigh performers-Medium performers 0.02825289 0.02641127 0.03009451     0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSalary Increase (%) vs Performance: R code for boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Visualise the relationship between Salary Increase and Performance\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\nchart1&lt;-df_salary|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y=SalaryIncrease, x=Performance, colour=Performance))+\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.45, outlier.alpha = 0.15, colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.12, alpha = 0.08, size = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun=\"mean\", geom=\"point\", size=2)+\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = \"errorbar\", width=0.2, size=0.8, position = position_dodge())+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(x=\"Performance Group\", y=\"Salary Increase (%)\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14, face=\"bold.italic\"),\n        axis.title= element_text(size=14, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face=\"italic\"),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(size=13, face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.caption = element_text(size=11, face=\"italic\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Salary Increase (%) by Performance Group\", \n          subtitle = \"(95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean)\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Print the chart\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\nchart1\n\n\n\n\n\nSalary Increase (%) by Performance Group (click the chart to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity Increase (%) by Performance\nSimilar to salary increases, the one-way ANOVA indicates statistically significant differences in equity award increases across performance groups (p &lt; .001).

This result indicates limited differentiation in total compensation outcomes among top performers.\n\n\nChanges in Compa-Ratio\nTo assess the impact of the compensation review process on employees’ salary positioning, another analysis looks at Compa-Ratio before and after the comp review. Because compa-ratio is measured for the same employees at two points in time, the analysis uses paired t-tests (within-employee comparisons) to test whether compa-ratio changed after the review overall and within each performance group.

On average, medium performers experienced an increase of approximately 5.0 percentage points, while high performers saw a larger average increase of around 7.8 percentage points, indicating stronger upward movement within the salary range for higher performers. Although only a small number of low performers received salary adjustments, those who did also showed a modest but statistically significant increase in compa-ratio. Overall, these findings suggest that the compensation review process not only differentiated reward levels, but also systematically improved salary positioning in line with performance, reinforcing a pay-for-performance structure."
