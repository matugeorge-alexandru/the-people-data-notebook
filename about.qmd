Hi there, I’m **George-Alexandru Matu** and I currently work as a Senior People Data Analyst.

I've decided to build **The People Data Notebook** for three main reasons:

-   To serve as my data analytics portfolio website
-   To popularize the field of people analytics among data enthusiasts and HR practitioners
-   To share a few practical examples of real HR business questions, showcasing how using people analytics can lead to better decisions.

My trajectory towards people analytics was somewhat atypical, as I have a **PhD in Sociology** and I initially dreamed of becoming a university professor. Although I truly enjoyed teaching and deep-diving into interesting research topics, I eventually decided that academia was not the right fit for me. People analytics felt like a natural career transition, as it allows me to continue analyzing survey responses, performing statistical analyses, working with qualitative data, and writing concise, actionable reports.

As many other people data analysts, I work at the intersection of **data analytics, data science, data governance, and decision-making**.

I’m originally from Romania but I currently live in Madrid, with my loving partner, Ada, and our cat, Vlahuta. Outside of work, I love to play chess, cook and take long walks.
