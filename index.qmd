title: "The People Data Notebook"
---

This notebook showcases how employee and workforce data can be used to support better decisions about the most valuable resource of any organisation: its people.

HR is often seen only as a support function, with an inherent desire to create useless administrative workload for the entire organisation and where decisions are driven by opinion rather than evidence. People analytics challenges these assumptions and shows how data-driven people decisions can be beneficial for both the organisations and the employees.

If you are new to the field, it is worth mentioning that there are a lot of useful People Analytics & HR resources out there. See for example the <a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/" style="color:#0066cc; font-weight:600;">Academy to Innovate HR blog</a> or the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/data-driven-hr-monthly-6793421002836590592/" style="color:#0066cc; font-weight:600;">Data Driven HR Monthly newsletter</a>, as well as some great books that showcase actual <strong>data projects</strong> in the field of people analytics:

-   <a href="https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/" style="color:#0066cc; font-weight:600;">Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics</a>\
-   <a href="https://ona-book.org/" style="color:#0066cc; font-weight:600;">Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics</a>, both by Keith McNulty\
-   <a href="https://rforhr.com/" style="color:#0066cc; font-weight:600;">R for HR: An Introduction to Human Resource Analytics Using R</a> by David Caughlin

While designed as data analytics portfolio, through this website I hope to share a few practical examples of real HR business questions, contributing to the popularization of people analytics for better people decisions.
